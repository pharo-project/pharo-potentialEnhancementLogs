# General
This list is a list of little actions that will make us more productive. 

- The list of menu should distinguish Refactorings and code transformation. 

# Refactorings 

- inline on non self-send should not raise a DNU when applied from SmartSuggestion.

# Code Transformation

- an inline... menu item should be added in the code transformation section. This inline on non self-send could propose to the user to pick up the wished implementation and expand it. 
- move to class / instance should be moved to the transformation section.
- move to class could add class to self-send

# Renraku

- move the RB rules to their renraku counterpart. 
- systematize code transformation. Rules should offer as much as possible code transformation.
