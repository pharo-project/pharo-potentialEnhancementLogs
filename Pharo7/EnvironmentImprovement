# General
This list is a list of little actions that will make us more productive. Please add your ideas and wish list but consider that it will not magically happen and 
that if you can give a hand it will increase the chances that it will happen.

- The list of menu should distinguish Refactorings and code transformation. 

# Refactorings 

- inline on non self-send should not raise a DNU when applied from SmartSuggestion.
- Swap ifTrue:ifFalse: by ifFalse:ifTrue: to help writing guard.
- swap condition, e.g iFalse: [ someBoolean and: [ an expression ] ] => ifF
- Add parameter should let us edit the parameter name.

- Refactorings should not hardcode the description of Error because it prevents the tools to simply use the error in case they need it.
- add shortcuts for refactorings, especially the most used (e.g. extract method)

- we should check that we have refactorings listed at https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/refactoring-source-code.html in Pharo and that they work well

# Code Transformation

- an inline... menu item should be added in the code transformation section. This inline on non self-send could propose to the user to pick up the wished implementation and expand it. 
- move to class / instance should be moved to the transformation section.
- move to class could add class to self-send

# Renraku

- move the RB rules to their renraku counterpart. 
- systematize code transformation. Rules should offer as much as possible code transformation.
